```

## Services at a glance

### `arm-ui`
- **Image:** custom, `nginx:alpine` + built SPA bundle.
- **Replicas:** 1.
- **Inputs:** browser traffic.
- **Outputs:** proxied calls to Backend.
- **State:** none. Fully stateless.
- **Notes:** SPA can be rebuilt and redeployed without touching Backend. Vue 3 (Composition API + `<script setup>`) chosen for the contributor team's existing fluency; Pinia for stores, vue-router for routing.

### `arm-backend`
- **Image:** custom, Python 3.14 + FastAPI + Uvicorn + docker-py.
- **Replicas:** 1. (Not horizontally scalable in v3.0 — it owns the WS hub and the state machine.)
- **Inputs:** REST + WS from UI and rippers; Docker socket for spawning transcoders.
- **Outputs:** Postgres writes; container spawns; outbound HTTPS to TMDB/OMDB/MB/notifications.
- **State:** all durable state is in Postgres. The WS hub's connection table is in-memory and rebuilt on reconnect.
- **Notes:** Requires `/var/run/docker.sock` mounted to spawn `arm-transcode` containers.

### `arm-ripper-<drive>`
- **Image:** custom, Python 3.14 + MakeMKV + libdvdcss + abcde.
- **Replicas:** one ripper container per drive, created by the backend on enroll (label `arm.drive_id`) — not declared as separate services in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Inputs:** polled `ioctl(CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS)` on passed-through `/dev/sr*`; REST/WS config from Backend.
- **Outputs:** raw media files under `/raw/<job-id>/`; REST status updates + WS progress to Backend.
- **State:** ephemeral. All persistent state is pushed to Backend.
- **Notes:** Reads `ARM_DRIVE_DEV` env var on boot (e.g. `/dev/sr0`) and registers with Backend at startup. Never talks to the internet.

### `arm-transcode-<uuid>`
- **Image:** custom, Python 3.14 + HandBrakeCLI + ffmpeg + optional VAAPI/NVENC/QSV drivers.
- **Replicas:** zero at rest. Backend spawns one container per transcode job; the container exits when the job completes.
- **Inputs:** transcode job spec via env / mounted config; raw files from `/raw` (read-only).
- **Outputs:** transcoded files to `/media`; REST status + WS progress to Backend.
- **State:** none. Job spec comes from Backend at container creation.
- **Notes:** Auto-detects available hardware encoders and advertises them to Backend on handshake. Backend flag `ARM_AUTO_TRANSCODE` toggles "spawn when idle" vs. "user must initiate."

### `arm-db`
- **Image:** `postgres:18`.
- **Replicas:** 1.
- **Notes:** Bootstrap credentials come from env vars; all other config (TMDB key, Apprise URLs, etc.) lives in DB rows written through the UI, stored plaintext.

## Data flow: disc insertion to finished file

1. **Disc insertion.** Ripper detects via polling `ioctl(CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS)` on its bound `/dev/sr*` every 2s. No udev rules on host or in container.
2. **Identify.** Ripper reads disc type (DVD/BD/CD/data) and performs a MakeMKV scan on DVD/BD to extract track layout (per-title durations, stream info) plus the disc's volume label; MakeMKV itself does not surface episode titles, feature-vs-extra labels, or disc numbers — rich metadata comes from the external lookup in the next step (~30-90s latency floor, surfaced in the UI as "Analyzing disc…"). CDs use MusicBrainz Disc ID.
3. **Lookup.** Ripper calls `POST /api/ripper/identify` on Backend with the scan result. Backend queries TMDB/OMDB/MB. Ripper blocks on this call.
   - On hit: Backend returns title + year + artwork URL + suggested track layout. A `Job` row is created in state `identified`.
   - On miss: behavior depends on `config.block_on_miss`. Default (`true`): Backend returns `status: "needs_user_input"`, UI shows a prompt, ripper waits for resolution — disc stays in drive, rip does not start. Opt-in (`false`): ripper begins ripping immediately to `/raw/<job_id>/` (raw paths key on `job_id`, which is assigned pre-identify and never changes). Transcode is gated on identity: queued `session_applications` remain in `waiting_identify` until the user resolves identity, then fan out against the resolved title. No files are ever renamed or moved — the only path that could encode identity is the `/media` path, and nothing is written there until identity exists. A rip is **never** cancelled by miss-handling.
4. **Rip.** Ripper creates one `Track` row per title and begins ripping. Each track's state transitions `queued → in_progress → done|failed`. Progress streams over WS.
5. **Rip complete.** Ripper emits `rip.completed` event, ejects disc, returns to idle.
6. **Auto-session (if configured).** If the drive has a `default_session_id` set and auto-transcode is on, Backend queues a session application for that session against the new job.
7. **Transcode spawn.** Backend dequeues a transcode job and spawns `arm-transcode-<uuid>` via Docker socket. Container mounts `/raw` read-only and `/media` read-write, receives job spec via env.
8. **Transcode.** Worker runs HandBrake, streams progress over WS, writes output to `/media/<layout>/<title>`.
9. **Transcode complete.** Worker emits `session.completed` event, container exits, Backend updates state, notifications fire.
10. **Done.** Raw is retained by default (no auto-prune). User can queue additional sessions from UI at any time.

## Drive polling (`CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS`)

The ripper reads disc presence directly via `ioctl(CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS)` on its bound `/dev/sr*`. This is the same ioctl `udev`'s `cdrom_id` helper uses to emit `ID_CDROM_MEDIA` events — we are not inventing a mechanism, just cutting out the event router so the ripper works inside a container without host-side udev config.

**Mechanics.** Open `/dev/sr*` with `O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK` (so `open()` does not block on an empty or open tray), call the ioctl, close. It's a controller query — no disc I/O, no spin-up, cheap to run every 2s. No root required; the ripper user needs membership in `cdrom`.

**Return values** (from `<linux/cdrom.h>`):

| Value | Constant | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `CDS_NO_INFO` | Drive does not report status (rare on modern hardware) |
| 1 | `CDS_NO_DISC` | Tray closed, empty |
| 2 | `CDS_TRAY_OPEN` | Tray out |
| 3 | `CDS_DRIVE_NOT_READY` | Spinning up / reading TOC |
| 4 | `CDS_DISC_OK` | Ready to read |

**Insert transition.** `NO_DISC` or `TRAY_OPEN` → `DRIVE_NOT_READY` (1–5s while the drive reads TOC) → `DISC_OK`. `DRIVE_NOT_READY` is treated as "keep polling," not an error.

**During an active rip.** Polling is suspended once MakeMKV starts reading the disc. The drive is being actively read, and the signal that matters — "did a read fail?" — bubbles up through MakeMKV directly. A user-initiated mid-rip eject manifests as a read error, not a status transition we need to race for. This also forecloses a v2-era failure mode (see issue #1731, PR #1703) where multiple insert events spawned duplicate rip processes on the same `/dev/sr*`: with one long-running ripper owning the drive and polling gated on rip state, a second rip cannot start on a disc that is already being read.

**After rip completion.** Ripper auto-ejects, polling resumes, and the ripper waits for `TRAY_OPEN` → `NO_DISC` → `DISC_OK` to detect the next disc. No state is held between discs — each `DISC_OK` transition allocates a fresh `job_id`.

## Shared volumes

| Volume | Mount path | Writers | Readers | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `arm_raw` | `/raw` | Rippers | Transcoders (ro) | Flat tree: `/raw/<job_id>/<track>.mkv`. No auto-prune. |
| `arm_media` | `/media` | Transcoders | (user's media server) | Plex/Jellyfin-friendly layout by default; session templates can override. |
| `arm_logs` | `/logs` | All services | Backend (for UI log view) | JSONL per service; lines include `job_id` for correlation. |
| `arm_config` | `/config` | Backend | All services | App-level config written via UI. |

## Privilege & security model

- **Backend mounts the Docker socket.** Standard homelab pattern (Traefik, Watchtower). Treat `arm-backend` as host-root-equivalent.
- **Ripper gets device access.** `--device /dev/sr0:/dev/sr0` with whatever cgroup rules MakeMKV needs.
- **Transcode may get GPU device access.** `--device /dev/dri` or nvidia runtime, conditionally.
- **UI and DB are unprivileged.**

## What's NOT in this diagram

- **Queue / broker.** We considered DB-as-queue, Redis, NATS. The decision is deferred — the state machine is designed so the queue can be swapped in without reshaping services. See [07-open-questions.md](07-open-questions.md).
- **Metadata worker.** Backend does TMDB/OMDB/MusicBrainz lookups inline. This stays inline for v3 — lookup latency is dominated by the MakeMKV scan anyway, and a separate worker is complexity without payoff at homelab scale.
