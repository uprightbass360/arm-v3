# 02 — Job Lifecycle & Crash Recovery

Crash-safe batch ripping is a top-three reason v3 exists. This document spells out exactly what state a job can be in, what triggers a transition, and how the system recovers after an unclean shutdown.

## Entities

Four long-lived entities drive the lifecycle, plus one reusable template:

- **Job** — one disc insertion. Created when a ripper identifies an inserted disc. Owns the overall rip outcome.
- **Track** — one logical piece of a disc (one title on a DVD/BD, one song on a CD, one dump on a data disc). Created per track once identification succeeds. This is the **unit of checkpointing**.
- **Session Application** — the durable record of "apply session S to job J." Created when a user (or `drives.default_session_id` auto-apply) queues a session against a rip. Carries its own state machine and owns the fan-out into **Transcode Tasks**.
- **Transcode Task** — the unit of work a single `arm-transcode` container executes. One session application fans out to N tasks, one per track being transcoded.

**Session** is not itself a lifecycle entity. It is a named, reusable bundle of (rip preset, transcode preset, output path template) scoped to a media type. Users pick a session to apply to a rip; applying creates a Session Application. Full definition in [§ Session model details](#session-model-details).

                    (downstream session applications may queue)
```

Terminal states for a `Job`: `ripped`, `ripped_partial`, `abandoned` (user gave up in UI), `failed` (identification failed catastrophically). Abandoning also ejects the disc: the ripper's `job.abandoned` WS handler pops the tray when the abandoned job owns the drive's pipeline (ripping or parked) or when the drive sits idle with the disc still seated — a stale abandon while a different job's rip owns the drive never touches the tray.

## Track state machine

Every track is a row with a status column. Within a single rip, tracks move through this machine sequentially as the ripper works:

```
    ┌────────┐                           ┌─────────────┐
    │ queued │ ────────────────────────▶ │ in_progress │
    └────────┘                           └──────┬──────┘
                                                │
                                ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
                                ▼                               ▼
                            ┌──────┐                        ┌──────┐
                            │ done │                        │failed│
                            └──────┘                        └──────┘
```

There is no `stale` state and no per-track claim. With one ripper container per drive (see [01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md)), the ripper that creates the tracks is the only writer for the lifetime of the disc — no other process can race for them.

A `Track` carries these fields relevant to recovery:
- `status` — one of the states above.
- `attempts` — how many times this track has been tried (incremented on a job-level reset; see below).

## Crash recovery: restart the rip from scratch

A rip is interrupted only by something that takes the whole ripper process down — overwhelmingly that means a power outage or a host reboot. Backend-only restarts don't interrupt rips (the ripper keeps working and replays its state-transition REST calls when Backend comes back); ripper-only crashes are rare in practice (single-purpose container, Docker restart policy brings it back in seconds).

When an interruption does happen, **the entire rip restarts from scratch**: every track for that job is reset to `queued`, the `/raw/<job_id>/` folder is wiped, the ripper re-runs MakeMKV against the disc, and previously-"done" tracks are re-ripped. There is no per-track resume.

Why no resume of done tracks? Three reasons:

1. **MakeMKV can't resume a partial title** — that boundary already forced re-ripping the in-progress one.
2. **Filesystem durability is not guaranteed track-by-track.** A "done" file recorded in the DB may not have hit disk before the power cut (no per-track `fsync`). Trusting it would risk silent corruption in the library.
3. **The cost is small in practice.** Interruptions are rare. Re-ripping a few done tracks on a once-in-a-blue-moon power cut is cheaper than carrying the durability machinery to make partial state trustworthy.

Two recovery paths trigger the reset:

- **Backend-startup sweep (one-shot, no timeout).** On boot, before serving traffic, Backend finds every job with `status='ripping'` — by definition all such jobs were interrupted, since Backend was just down — sets `resumed_from_crash=true`, resets every track for those jobs to `queued`, increments each track's `attempts`, and instructs the relevant rippers to wipe `/raw/<job_id>/` before re-rip.
- **Ripper-startup probe.** When a ripper container starts, it polls its drive (`ioctl(CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS)`); if a disc is present and Backend reports an in-flight job for the drive in `status='ripping'`, the ripper calls `POST /api/ripper/jobs/{job_id}/resume`. Backend performs the same reset (mark resumed, requeue all tracks, increment attempts) and the ripper wipes `/raw/<job_id>/` and starts over.

Both paths converge on the same DB transition; the difference is who initiates it (Backend on its own boot, or the ripper on its boot when Backend was up the whole time).

The UI marks a job "resumed from crash" until its next terminal state.

### What this buys us

- **Power cut mid-batch.** Every interrupted job is found by the Backend-startup sweep and restarted from scratch. No per-track timeouts to wait out, no orphan claims to clean up.
- **Ripper container crashes alone.** Docker restart brings it back; the ripper-startup probe handles the reset. Backend was never down so its in-memory WS subscribers reconnect naturally.
- **Backend crashes, rippers keep ripping.** Nothing to recover. Rippers buffer state-transition REST calls (`complete`, `fail`, `job-complete`) with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 30s cap) until Backend is back. WS progress messages dropped during the outage are simply not delivered; the next message replaces them. The DB row is still source of truth.

### What this does NOT do

- **Resume mid-track or mid-job.** Interruption means full restart of the rip — every track, including ones the DB says were `done`. Accepted by design (see reasons above).
- **Detect a hung-but-not-crashed ripper.** If MakeMKV wedges without the container exiting, no automatic detection. The user sees flat progress in the UI and restarts the ripper container manually, which triggers the ripper-startup probe.

## Session Application & Transcode Task lifecycle

Session Applications are the runtime record of "apply this session to this job"; Transcode Tasks are the execution units that fan out from an application. They have separate lifecycles. (The Session itself is a template and has no runtime state — see [§ Session model details](#session-model-details).)

```

`waiting_identify` is the durable "this session application is parked until there is something to fan out" state: until the disc is identified, and until the rip has persisted its Track rows (the ripper writes them at rip-start, so a session applied or resolved before that has no tracks yet). Resolve and rip-complete both drain parked applications; whichever runs once tracks exist promotes them to `queued`. See [§ Unidentified and placeholder rips](#unidentified-and-placeholder-rips) for the transitions around it.

### Transcode task state machine

`queued → in_progress → (done | failed | stale)`, with per-task claims and heartbeats — see `transcode_tasks.claimed_by` / `claim_heartbeat_at` in [04-data-model.md](04-data-model.md#transcode_tasks). Unlike the rip side, multiple ephemeral transcoder containers really do compete for queued tasks, so the claim mechanism is load-bearing here. The stale-claim sweep applies; HandBrake can't resume mid-transcode either, so `stale → queued` means "re-transcode that file from scratch" — but already-`done` sibling tasks in the same session application keep their output.

### Transcode capability and the disabled state

Whether encode work can happen at all is a **two-layer switch**:

- **Tier 1 — `ARM_TRANSCODE_CAPABLE` (env, deployment fact).** Default `true`. A ripper-only install (`devtools/setup-dev.sh --ripper-only` in dev; the installer rewrite's equivalent in production) writes `false` — this box cannot run a transcode container, full stop. A configured `ARM_TRANSCODE_DOCKER_HOST` implies capability regardless of the flag (you cannot be incapable of something you've wired a remote docker host for); the contradictory combo (`ARM_TRANSCODE_CAPABLE=false` with `ARM_TRANSCODE_DOCKER_HOST` set) logs a startup warning rather than failing to boot. See [05-cross-cutting.md § Configuration strategy](05-cross-cutting.md#configuration-strategy).
- **Tier 2 — `config.transcode_enabled` (DB, runtime toggle).** The Settings → Transcoding switch. Enabling it is refused with `422` when the deployment isn't capable (Tier 1 gates Tier 2, not the other way round). A `NULL` column (rows that predate migration `0037_transcode_enabled`) reads as *enabled* — the seeder backfills it on next boot, so upgrading changes nothing for an existing install.

**Disabled gates ENCODE work only — passthrough is unaffected.** A session with no transcode preset, or a preset whose `tool` is `TranscodeTool.NONE`, is a file move, not an encode, and always runs regardless of either switch. Concretely, when transcode is not enabled (not capable, or capable-but-toggled-off):

- **Manual apply** of a session that resolves to an encode preset is refused with `422 transcoding is disabled (Settings > Transcoding); only passthrough sessions can be applied`.
- **Auto-apply and identity-resolve fan-out** skip the same way, with `skipped_reason="transcode_disabled"` on the outcome, instead of erroring — a `drives.default_session_id` auto-queue against an encode session on a disabled deployment just doesn't fan out, rather than raising.
- **Already-queued encode tasks are held**, not cancelled or dropped: `spawn_pending` (the dispatcher tick) leaves them in `queued` and re-checks every tick, so re-enabling `config.transcode_enabled` resumes them where the FIFO left off. A **running** container is left alone — it finishes; disabling doesn't kill in-flight work.

**Passthrough always executes in-process in the Backend dispatcher, never in a container.** `spawn_pending` classifies each queued task by its preset (`is_passthrough_preset`) before checking either capability switch: passthrough tasks skip both gates entirely and are not counted against `config.max_parallel_transcodes` — a ripper-only box with `ARM_TRANSCODE_CAPABLE=false` and no docker client still drains its passthrough queue every tick. The claim (task → `in_progress`, `claimed_by="backend-inprocess"`) is committed *before* the file move runs, so the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` row locks from the batch select are released before any blocking, possibly cross-mount I/O — a slow passthrough move can't stall a freshly spawned encode container's `/claim` call. The move itself uses the same move-or-copy as the retired passthrough container (`transcode_none`): an `os.rename` into `/media` at the path `compute_outputs` resolved, which is atomic when `/raw` and `/media` share a filesystem. Across mounts (`EXDEV`, the shipped compose layout) it falls back to copy+unlink, and that copy writes the final path directly, so it is **not** atomic: a library scanner can observe a partially-copied file until the copy finishes. The transcodes UI sees the same task lifecycle either way.

**NFS / ownership note.** Because passthrough finalize runs inside the Backend process rather than a spawned container, it writes as the **Backend container's own uid** — the operator's `PUID` must have write access to `/media` (not just the transcoder's). `ARM_TRANSCODE_PUID` still governs the uid a *remote or encode* transcode container drops to, and is applied best-effort as a `chown` after an in-process move completes (a harmless no-op against a root-squashed export).

### Encoder claim and apply-time refusal

A transcode preset names one catalog **encoder** (`arm_common.encoders`), not
a codec plus a hardware preference. The dispatcher's `_claim_gpu_for_task`
resolves what to spawn from that id:

- `preset` and `cpu_<codec>` never touch a GPU: they spawn immediately.
- `any_<codec>` picks the best-ranked eligible device (NVENC, then QSV, then
  VAAPI, then device path) that is free. If eligible devices exist but are
  all busy, the task stays `queued`. **If no eligible device exists on this
  host at all, the task runs the CPU encoder for that codec** instead of
  waiting, so a built-in preset defaulting to `any_h265` keeps working on a
  CPU-only install.
- `<vendor>_<codec>` (a specific `qsv_*` / `nvenc_*` / `vaapi_*` id) only
  ever claims a device of that vendor. All busy: queue. **None eligible at
  apply time**: the apply is refused with `skipped_reason="encoder_unavailable"`,
  mapped to `422` for manual apply (auto-apply and the waiting-identify
  promotion skip the same way instead of erroring). **None eligible while a
  task is already queued** (the device was disabled, removed, or re-probed
  without that codec after the apply): the task fails with
  `last_error = "no enabled device has verified <encoder id>; re-probe or
  enable it in Settings > GPUs"`, retryable through the normal retry path.
  `any_*`, `cpu_*` and `preset` are never refused on availability.
- A device is **eligible** for a codec only when it is `enabled`, has been
  probed at least once (`probed_at IS NOT NULL`), and that probe's verified
  list includes the codec (`arm_common.encoders.gpu_is_eligible`). A device
  that is mid-probe right now is skipped by the claim exactly like a busy
  one, so a task queues rather than falling back to CPU while a probe is in
  flight.
- **Awaiting a first probe.** When no device is eligible but an enabled,
  never-probed device that could serve the encoder is awaiting its probe
  (`TranscodeDispatcher.awaiting_probe`: reserved by the boot pass in
  `pending_probe_gpu_ids`, running in `probing_gpu_ids`, or the boot pass has
  not listed its rows yet), the claim returns `queue` with reason
  `waiting for GPU probe` for `any_*` and vendor-pinned encoders alike, and
  the apply-time gate does not refuse a vendor-pinned encoder. A never-probed
  device with no probe scheduled keeps the fallback bounded: `any_*` runs on
  CPU and a vendor-pinned encoder fails as above.
- A preset whose stored `encoder` id is no longer in the catalog (a stale
  row from a removed encoder) fails at apply with `422` and at dispatch with
  `last_error = "preset <preset id> has unknown encoder '<value>'"`, failing
  only that task, not its session siblings.

See [Hardware Transcoding](../../user/Hardware-Transcoding.md) for the
per-device probe that populates eligibility and the vendor image variants
the dispatcher spawns.

## Why rip-level restart but task-level checkpointing for transcode

Two different cost models drove two different choices.

**Rip side: whole-job restart on interruption.** Crash recovery for a rip means re-running MakeMKV against the disc and overwriting `/raw/<job_id>/`. We accept re-ripping done tracks because (a) MakeMKV has no mid-title resume, so the in-progress track is already a re-rip; (b) "done" in the DB doesn't guarantee the file is durable on disk without a per-track `fsync` we don't issue; and (c) interruptions are rare — a power outage every few months that costs an extra 30 minutes of re-ripping is cheaper than the machinery to make per-track resume safe.

**Transcode side: per-task checkpointing.** A session application can fan out into many transcode tasks (one per ripped track), and a 4-hour batch transcode losing all progress on a Backend restart is a different cost than a 45-minute rip losing progress on a power cut. Transcode tasks have stable inputs (the raw files in `/raw/`, which don't change), no spinning physical media to babysit, and run in ephemeral containers that come and go anyway — so they're a natural fit for claim-and-heartbeat with per-task retry. Done tasks are kept; only the interrupted ones re-run.

## Session model details

A **Session** is a named composition of (rip preset, transcode preset, output path convention) that can be applied to any rip of the matching media type. Sessions are what users pick in the UI; the two preset tables under them hold the reusable rip-strategy and encoding building blocks.

- **Three tables, one user-facing concept.** `rip_presets` govern ripper behavior (track selection, identification mode, output mode — tracks vs ISO vs data copy). `transcode_presets` govern encoding (HandBrake preset reference, abcde profile, container, hardware preference). `sessions` compose one of each plus an `output_path_template`. Full field lists in [04-data-model.md](04-data-model.md#rip_presets). When `rip_preset.track_selection = custom`, `rip_preset.track_filters_json` carries the declarative filter (`min_duration_seconds`, `max_duration_seconds`, `title_indices` allowlist, `title_indices_exclude` blocklist — all conditions ANDed). The schema is owned by [`arm_common.schemas.TrackFilters`](../../../packages/arm_common/arm_common/schemas/sessions.py); the rip pipeline applies it via [`select_tracks`](../../../services/backend/arm_backend/track_selection.py).
- **Built-ins ship locked.** ARM seeds a set of built-in rip presets, transcode presets, and sessions on first boot, all with `is_builtin = true`. Built-ins are not editable through the API. The UI "New Session" wizard can pre-fill its form from any built-in, but saves a new row with `is_builtin = false`; no parent link is stored.
- **Sessions are scoped to a single media type** (`movie` | `tv` | `music` | `data` | `iso`). Any session can be applied to any rip *of the matching media type*. The UI filters the session picker by the rip's identified media type so the user can only pick a compatible session. `session.media_type` must equal the referenced rip preset's `media_type`, and (if a transcode preset is attached) the transcode preset's `media_type`.
- **Transcode preset is nullable.** ISO and data-copy sessions skip transcode entirely; their `transcode_preset_id` is null and no transcode task fans out.
- **Sessions are re-runnable.** A user can queue a session against a rip made six months ago. Re-running against a retired raw (if the user pruned it) is a clear error in the UI.

Concrete session fields (summary — full in [04-data-model.md](04-data-model.md#sessions)):

- `name` — unique per user (UI picker requirement; not used in filenames — `{transcode_slug}` handles that).
- `media_type` (enum: `movie` | `tv` | `music` | `data` | `iso`)
- `is_builtin` (bool)
- `rip_preset_id` (FK → `rip_presets`)
- `transcode_preset_id` (FK → `transcode_presets`, nullable)
- `output_path_template` — relative to the media-type library root; see "Output paths and naming" below.
- `overrides_json` — per-session tweaks layered on top of the referenced presets.
- `created_by_user_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### Why the three-table split

v2 bundled rip strategy + transcode settings + output convention into a single "session" concept. That works for simple cases but doesn't cleanly express things the community has been asking for: home-movie rips (no identification), ISO dumps (no transcode), multiple output formats from the same source (MP3 + FLAC from the same CD), per-disc-type encoding differences (DVD vs Blu-ray vs 4K UHD). Decomposing rip behavior and transcode behavior into independently-reusable presets, then recomposing them at the session layer, keeps the user-facing story ("pick a session") while making the parts separately extensible. See GitHub discussion [#815](https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine/discussions/815) for the design origin.

## Output paths and naming

### `/raw` — intermediate storage

Rippers write to `/raw/{job_id}/`, one directory per disc insertion. Filenames inside follow MakeMKV's native output convention (`title_tNN.mkv`) plus any sidecars MakeMKV emits. This directory is internal to the pipeline and is never exposed to media scanners; users don't browse `/raw`.

Cleanup: when every transcode task derived from a job reaches a terminal state and retention policy allows, the whole `/raw/{job_id}/` directory is removed. Retention is user-configurable; the default is `keep_forever` — the data-hoarder profile from [00-vision.md](00-vision.md) is the dominant user, so the safe default is to keep raw bits until the operator explicitly opts out (set `default_retention_policy=prune_after_session` in the Config singleton, or per-job).

### `/media` — user-facing library

The top-level library shape mirrors the Plex/Jellyfin convention — both scanners agree at this granularity, so "Plex-friendly" and "Jellyfin-friendly" are the same thing:

```
/media/
  Movies/
    {Title} ({Year})/
      {Title} ({Year}) - {transcode_slug}.mkv
  TV Shows/
    {Show} ({Year})/
      Season {NN}/
        {Show} - S{NN}D{DD}T{NN} ({HH}h{MM}m) - {transcode_slug}.mkv
  Music/
    {Artist}/
      {Album}/
        {NN} - {Track} - {transcode_slug}.flac
```

The three top-level folder names (`Movies`, `TV Shows`, `Music`) are configurable per install (env vars, default to the above). The subtree shape is fixed by media type — changing it would break scanner matching, which is the whole point of picking a convention.

**Why `{transcode_slug}` is in the default filename.** The same raw rip is commonly transcoded in multiple encodings (1080p H.265, 4K HDR, phone-friendly). Including the transcode preset name as a suffix in the same folder is the native Plex/Jellyfin idiom for "versions of the same title" — both scanners group sibling files matching `{Title} ({Year}) - *.ext` as alternate versions, and the version selector on the movie page then shows `1080p-h265` vs `4k-hdr` as meaningful labels the user actually picked. Without this suffix, two transcodes of the same source would collide on one filename. `{transcode_slug}` is unavailable for ISO and data-copy sessions (no transcode preset); their default templates don't include it. See "Concurrent write safety" below for the handling when two sessions legitimately resolve to the same slug (e.g. same transcode preset, different rip preset).

### Filename templates: honest mechanical names

**Templates apply at transcode time, not rip time.** The rip step itself produces only `/raw/{job_id}/title_tNN.mkv` (MakeMKV's native naming) — see "/raw" above. Identity-derived filenames are an artifact of the transcoder writing into `/media/`, expanded against whatever identity has been applied to the job by then. Everything in this section describes the *transcode-output* names a user eventually sees in their library; nothing here runs during the rip.

The core design principle: **don't pretend to know what we don't know.** MakeMKV surfaces only a track layout (per-title durations, stream info) and the disc's volume label — no episode titles, no season or disc numbers, no "this is the main feature" signal; per-track names come back as generic `title_nn`. Title and year are resolved by the TMDB/OMDB lookup at identify time. Season, disc number and disc total are proposed from the Blu-ray disc title (BDMT) and the volume label when they encode them, and the operator's entry always wins; values carry their source in `identity_provenance`. Per-title season and episode come from TheDiscDB and operator edits, resolved with provenance tracking, and the `{season}` naming token prefers the title's own season over the disc's. TV box sets are the routine case where identify lands in `awaiting_user_id` waiting for the user to supply missing identity. Defaults therefore generate mechanical names the user can rename in `/media` after transcode completes, for scanner-perfect matching.

**Movies** — relative path, prefixed by `Movies/` at write time:

- Longest feature-length track → `{Title} ({Year})/{Title} ({Year}) - {transcode_slug}.{ext}`
- Other feature-length tracks (≥ 80 min) → `{Title} ({Year})/{Title} ({Year}) - Track {NN} ({HH}h{MM}m) - {transcode_slug}.{ext}`
- User renames to `{Title} ({Year}) {edition-Director's Cut} - {transcode_slug}.{ext}` etc. when they know which alternate cut is which.

Multi-feature discs (extended editions, alternate endings) produce multiple feature-length tracks with *different* file sizes — the ripper surfaces these in the UI at rip-selection time so the user can pick which to rip. Alternate-angle tracks behave the same way at our layer: an "angle" is a DVD/Blu-ray feature where a single playlist encodes multiple time-synchronized video streams the player hot-swaps between via the remote's angle button (concert footage from different cameras is the canonical legitimate use; adult content is where it shows up most often in the wild). The disc-spec mechanism is in-title branching, but MakeMKV flattens that and enumerates each angle as its own title — so they appear in the selection UI as several long tracks of near-identical duration, indistinguishable from any other multi-feature case, and the user picks. No special handling. Whether these surfacing rules fire automatically is governed by the `rip_preset.track_filters_json` — the `main_feature` rip preset enables "flag multi-feature," `archive` disables it, `custom` lets the user wire their own rules.

**TV** — relative path, prefixed by `TV Shows/` at write time:

- All tracks → `{Show} ({Year})/Season {NN}/{Show} - S{NN}D{DD}T{NN} ({HH}h{MM}m) - {transcode_slug}.{ext}`

Season + disc + track + duration + session in a predictable, greppable pattern. **No guessed `SNNEMM` from disc order:** disc order is not always episode order, and silently guessing wrong is worse than shipping honest names. Episode numbers come only from [episode matching](#episode-matching), and a template uses them through the `{episode}` token. When a template includes `{episode}`, the token renders `01-E02` for a title spanning two episodes, and a TV template's episode tokens render empty (instead of failing) for titles whose role is not an episode: the path segments holding them are tidied (`S01E - .mkv` becomes `S01.mkv`) and, if the template has no `{track}`, ` - T{track}` is appended to the file name so a disc's bonus titles never share a path.

"Play All" tracks (a single long track that concatenates every episode on the disc) appear with the same mechanical name, and land in the Season folder. They are *not* auto-detected and filtered — "duration ≈ sum of other tracks" doesn't work because special features on the same disc confound the heuristic. Instead, the ripper UI surfaces all tracks with their durations at rip-selection time, and the user deselects Play All (or any tracks they don't want) before the rip starts. The naming layer stays mechanical.

**Music (CD)** — relative path, prefixed by `Music/` at write time:

- `{Artist}/{Album}/{NN} - {Track} - {transcode_slug}.{ext}`

This is the one case where ARM has reliable track-level metadata (MusicBrainz, CD-Text), so we use it. Track titles are populated automatically. The transcode slug disambiguates parallel FLAC-and-MP3 sessions against the same CD (abcde profile name, slugified — same mechanism as the HandBrake case).

### Episode matching

Per-track season and episode numbers (the `{episode}` token above) come from a separate background stage (`identity/episode_stage.py`), not from the identify step itself. It matches a TV job's tracks against ranked episode-list providers, by default TMDb, then TVmaze, then TVDB (`DEFAULT_EPISODE_SOURCES` in `identity/sources/registry.py`), comparing track runtimes (runtimes only, never titles) against each provider's episode list. Only one provider's placement is used for a job: the resolver takes the first usable provider in rank order, or the operator's pinned one, and ignores the rest. The stage runs after a TV candidate is identified, again at rip start (when a disc that was not held for review first gets its tracks), again whenever season, disc number, media type, the identity title or the show ids change (via `PATCH` or `/resolve`), and once at startup for any identified, `awaiting_review`, `awaiting_user_id` or `ripping` job that has no episode source entry yet, so a job is never left unmatched because it finished before this stage existed or because the backend restarted mid-rip. Ripped jobs are not swept. A confident result is applied automatically. An uncertain one (ambiguous positions, low coverage or confidence, a thin or truncated season scan, nominal runtimes, a conflicting sibling disc) is stored as a suggestion and applies only once the operator pins that source. Operators inspect and act on matches through `GET /api/jobs/{id}/identity`, `POST /api/jobs/{id}/identity/match` (preview by default, or apply and optionally pin a source; a season or disc number sent with an apply is kept as the operator's own), `DELETE /api/jobs/{id}/identity/pin`, and `GET /api/jobs/{id}/identity/episodes` (browse one season of a source's episode list; `season` is required). The episode stage and these identity endpoints fire a `job.identity_updated` WS event whenever they run the resolver. Which providers run, in what order, the runtime tolerance (an upper limit: ARM narrows it to a tenth of the episode's runtime, at least 60 seconds) and whether confident matches apply automatically are operator settings on Settings > Metadata > TV episodes (`episode_sources`, `episode_match_tolerance_seconds`, `episode_auto_apply`); unchecking a source stops it running and stops its stored matches applying, unless a job pins it. A manual `/identity/match` that names a source runs it even when that source is unchecked. A job pinned to a source keeps the tolerance stored when it was pinned. Which disc-hint sources run, and in what order, is set in the same section (`disc_hint_sources`); unchecking one stops it running and resets the fields it owned.

Every identity writer (title search, `/resolve`, the automatic lookups) stores the show's `tmdb`, `imdb` and `tvdb` ids plus `ExternalIds.tmdb_kind` (`movie` or `tv`), because TMDb numbers movies and series in separate id spaces. The stage never uses a movie-kind TMDb id as a show id: such a job falls back to the IMDb or TVDB id or waits for a TV identity. `PATCH /api/jobs/{id}` accepts `media_type`, so the operator can switch a job between movie and TV (a change re-runs the stage), and title-search candidates carry their `external_ids`. `JobView` exposes `looks_episodic` (the disc is a set of same-length episodes, so the UI defaults to TV) and `has_series` (a usable show id exists).

In ui-neu, a TV job has a **Match Episodes** tab on the job page: a status line (matched source, pin, season and disc), the other sources' results, accept-suggestion for an uncertain result, re-run with a preview before **Apply & pin**, unpin, and a per-track hand-set season and episode with revert. It is read-only for guests. The job header carries a Movie | TV switch (it asks before switching to Movie when tracks have hand-set episodes), and the title search has a Movie/TV toggle that defaults to TV for episodic discs. The panel ends its wait on `job.identity_updated`.

### `output_path_template` tokens

Sessions own the relative path from the media-type root down to the leaf filename. Tokens available at expansion time depend on the session's `media_type`:

| Token | movie | tv | music | Source |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| `{title}` | ✓ | — | — | identification |
| `{year}` | ✓ | ✓ | — | identification |
| `{show}` | — | ✓ | — | identification |
| `{season}` | — | ✓ | — | identification / user input (zero-padded) — usually user input for box sets, since volume labels rarely encode it |
| `{disc}` | — | ✓ | — | identification / user input (zero-padded) — same caveat as `{season}` |
| `{track}` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | MakeMKV / CD track number (zero-padded) |
| `{duration_human}` | ✓ | ✓ | — | MakeMKV (`{HH}h{MM}m`) |
| `{artist}` | — | — | ✓ | MusicBrainz / CD-Text |
| `{album}` | — | — | ✓ | MusicBrainz / CD-Text |
| `{track_title}` | — | — | ✓ | MusicBrainz / CD-Text |
| `{transcode_slug}` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | transcode preset `name` field, slugified (lowercase, spaces → hyphens, non-alphanumerics stripped). Unavailable when `session.transcode_preset_id IS NULL` (ISO, data-copy). |
| `{ext}` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | transcode preset `container` (`mkv`, `mp4`, `flac`, …) |

Templates are validated on session save: the backend expands the template against a synthetic job of the declared `media_type` and rejects the save if any token resolves to empty for a required slot. This is how we keep users from shipping a template that silently produces `/media/Movies/ ().mkv` on a real rip. Templates that reference `{transcode_slug}` are also rejected at save time when the session has no transcode preset attached.

### Concurrent write safety

Two layers of defense against overlapping writes to the same output path:

**Atomic rename on completion.** The transcoder writes to `<final>.arm-inprogress` in the final directory, `fsync`s, then `rename(2)` to the final path on success. Same filesystem, so the rename is atomic. Plex and Jellyfin don't match `.arm-inprogress` as a media extension, so half-written files are invisible to scanners — no "corrupt file" flags during transcode, no racy mid-transcode scanning. On crash, leftover `.arm-inprogress` files are swept by the transcoder at startup: any file matching `*.arm-inprogress` under `/media` with no corresponding `transcode_tasks` row in `in_progress` state is deleted. The `.arm-inprogress` suffix is unique to ARM so it never collides with `wget`/`aria2`-style `.part` files or editor `.tmp` files.

**Apply-time collision validation.** When a user applies a session to a job, the Backend resolves every task's output path *before* fan-out. Two failure cases:

1. **Cross-session collision** — two sessions' templates resolve to the same path. This is legal schema-wise: two sessions may share a `transcode_preset_id` while differing in `rip_preset_id` (e.g. one rips main feature only, the other rips the whole disc — the main-feature output path is produced by both). Caught at apply-time, not save-time: when the second session is applied to a job that already has the first session's outputs queued or on disk, the Backend surfaces the same overwrite prompt as the cross-job case below.
2. **Cross-job collision** — the same session applied to two different jobs that identify as the same title (user re-ripping a movie they already have). Caught at apply-time by a lookup against `transcode_tasks.output_path` for any row in `queued | in_progress | done` state, plus a filesystem check for files ARM didn't put there (pre-v3 content, manual user copies). On hit, the UI shows a dialog:

   > "This session would write `Iron Man (2008) - plex-1080p-h265.mkv`, which already exists. Options: (a) Overwrite the existing file; (b) Cancel."

   Option (a) sets `session_applications.overwrite = true`; the transcoder replaces the file atomically via the same `.arm-inprogress` → rename flow. Option (b) aborts the apply. No silent auto-suffix (`(2).mkv`) — that hides user intent and produces files neither scanner recognizes as meaningful versions.

**DB-level safety net.** A partial unique index on `transcode_tasks(output_path)` where `status IN ('queued', 'in_progress', 'done')` catches any path collision the apply-time check missed (concurrent applies, logic bugs). Failed tasks can share paths — their file is presumed absent.

**Idempotency.** Applying the same (session, job) pair twice returns the existing `session_application` rather than fanning out a second set of tasks.

### Unidentified and placeholder rips

When a user opts into placeholder-rip mode (`rip_presets.identification_mode = deferred_placeholder`, or the global `config.block_on_miss = false`), ripping proceeds immediately on an identification miss. The rip writes to `/raw/<job_id>/` exactly as a normal rip would — raw paths key on `job_id`, which is assigned pre-identify and is identity-independent (see [04-data-model.md § jobs](04-data-model.md)). **Nothing is ever renamed or moved as a consequence of identity resolution.**

Transcode is gated on identity, not on rip completion. Specifically:

- An auto-session queued via `drives.default_session_id` stays in `session_applications.status = waiting_identify` while the job is `awaiting_user_id`. No `transcode_tasks` rows exist yet — fan-out is deferred until identity resolves.
- A manual session apply against an unidentified job returns the same `waiting_identify` state rather than failing; the UI surfaces this as "queued — waiting for you to identify this disc."
- On identity resolution (`POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/resolve`), Backend transitions every `waiting_identify` session_application to `queued` and fans out `transcode_tasks` using the now-resolved title. Path templates expand against the resolved identity; output paths are correct from the first byte the transcoder writes.
- If resolve runs before the rip has started (no Track rows yet — the ripper persists them at rip-start), the application stays `waiting_identify` with `skipped_reason = no_tracks`. `rip-complete` drains parked applications before the drive-default auto-apply hook runs, so an explicit pre-rip session choice is never lost.
- If the user changes identity *again* after transcoding has already started (rare — requires them to re-open the resolve dialog post-identification), already-completed transcode outputs stay where they are. This is identical to the "user renamed the movie after transcoding" case, which v3 treats as out-of-scope manual cleanup. Queued and in-progress tasks are not re-pathed mid-flight.

The raw-side cleanup rule from [§ `/raw` — intermediate storage](#raw--intermediate-storage) applies unchanged: `/raw/<job_id>/` is removed per retention policy once all its derived transcodes are terminal.

## UI touchpoints during a job's life

- **Create phase:** UI shows "waiting for disc" on idle rippers.
- **Identify miss:** UI shows a manual-identify modal; ripper blocks until user resolves.
- **Rip in progress:** UI shows per-track progress bars via WS.
- **Ripped:** UI shows the job with available actions — queue session(s), edit metadata, delete raw.
- **Session queued:** UI shows transcode progress per task.
- **Resume after crash:** UI shows a "resumed from crash" banner on affected jobs/sessions.
