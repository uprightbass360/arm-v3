# ARM v3 Architecture

This directory captures the v3 architecture for the Automatic Ripping Machine as of 2026-04-18. v3 is a **ground-up rebuild** — no part of the v2 architecture is carried forward unconditionally.

**Repo layout.** ARM v3 occupies the repository root: `services/` (one directory per container image), `packages/arm_common/` (shared schemas + models), `devtools/`, `docs/`, and the root `docker-compose.yml`. v3 was developed in isolation under a `v3/` subtree and promoted to the root at cutover; that one-time process — and how v2 was retired from `main` — is recorded in [08-v2-isolation-and-cutover.md](08-v2-isolation-and-cutover.md).

## Quick summary

v3 is a **multi-container, Python-first** system built around a job/session state machine, per-drive ripper containers, and ad-hoc transcode containers. The Backend is the brain; everything else is a worker that talks to the Backend over REST + WebSocket.

| Service | Image | Lifetime | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **UI** | `arm-ui` | Long-running | SPA (Vite-built) served by nginx; consumes Backend API + WS |
| **Backend** | `arm-backend` | Long-running | FastAPI: job/session state machine, internet adapters, WS hub, spawns transcoders |
| **Ripper** | `arm-ripper` | Long-running, one per drive | Bound to a single `/dev/sr*`; identifies disc, rips to `/raw`, reports to Backend |
| **Transcode** | `arm-transcode` | Ad-hoc, one per transcode | Spawned by Backend; optional GPU pass-through; reports progress, exits |
| **DB** | `postgres:18` | Long-running | Source of truth for all state |

## Non-goals

Explicit non-goals for v3.0 — not features that are not done yet, but features we have actively decided **not** to pursue:

- **No TrueNAS / iX Systems support.** Not a supported target.
- **No v2 → v3 data migration.** v2 stays on its own tag; v3 starts from a clean schema.
- **No multi-tenancy / RBAC.** Target user is a single homelab hobbyist. One admin.
- **No Kubernetes / Helm.** Docker Compose is the only supported deploy surface.
- **No in-backend transcoding.** Transcode always runs in a dedicated ephemeral container.

## Status

This is a **first-draft architecture**, initially drawn up on 2026-04-18 and refined through a follow-up pass that resolved most of the first-draft open questions. A small set of decisions remain deliberately deferred (queue mechanism, frontend framework, base image + PID-1 strategy) — see [07-open-questions.md](07-open-questions.md).
