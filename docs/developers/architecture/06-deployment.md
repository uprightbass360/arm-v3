# 06 — Deployment

Docker Compose is the one and only supported deploy target for v3.

## Supported targets

- Any Linux host running Docker Engine ≥ 24 and Compose v2 ≥ 2.20 (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, …). This is the **one and only** supported target for v3.0; container deployment is distro-agnostic.

## Explicitly NOT supported

- Unraid, Synology DSM, QNAP, and other NAS-appliance container GUIs. They run stock Docker, so the generic Linux + Compose path may happen to work, but it is **untested and unsupported** for v3.0 — deploy via the documented `install.sh` + `docker compose` path or not at all. (Dropped 2026-06-05.)
- TrueNAS / iX Systems. Not a goal. Do not file bugs against it.
- Kubernetes / Helm.
- Docker Desktop on macOS/Windows **for ripping**. Internal SATA optical drives cannot be passed to the WSL2/macOS VM; USB drives via `usbipd-win` may work but are not tested. Windows and macOS users can still run the UI + transcoder stack as a library-management frontend (PUID/PGID works correctly on WSL2-native paths, named volumes, and SMB mounts — see "File ownership" below). NTFS bind mounts from `C:\...` are unsupported: the translation layer fakes ownership and ignores `chown`, so PUID becomes cosmetic.
- Podman (may work by accident; not tested).

## Install prefix and layout

The install script (see "Install" below) drops everything under a single prefix, **`~/arm/` by default**. The user never clones the repo, never runs a build, never reads source. The stack is entirely image-based.

```
~/arm/
├── .env                            # 0600 — generated; user edits optional fields
├── docker-compose.yml              # 0644 — generated per host
├── certs/                          # 0700
│   ├── arm-ca.key                  # 0400 — CA private key; NEVER mounted into a container
│   ├── arm-ca.crt                  # 0444 — mounted read-only into every service
│   ├── arm-backend.{key,crt}       # leaf for Backend
│   └── arm-ui.{key,crt}            # leaf for UI nginx
├── db/                             # Postgres data (bind-mount)
├── logs/                           # shared logs (PUID:PGID)
├── raw/                            # rip output (PUID:PGID, 2775 setgid)
└── media/                          # transcoded library (PUID:PGID, 2775 setgid)
```

The user runs the stack from this directory: `cd ~/arm && docker compose up -d`. All bind-mounts in the generated compose are relative (`./certs/...`, `./raw`, etc.), so moving `~/arm/` to `/srv/arm/` or `/mnt/tank/arm/` is a matter of moving the directory — nothing is hard-coded to `$HOME`.

## Build chain

v3 images are built fresh on upstream bases. They do **not** derive from the v2 `arm-dependencies` image, do **not** pull from the `arm-dependencies` submodule, and do **not** inherit `phusion/baseimage`.

- **No `arm-dependencies`.** That image existed to bake HandBrake / MakeMKV / libdvd-pkg on top of a shared phusion base for the v2 all-in-one container. v3 splits those workloads across separate images (only `arm-ripper` and `arm-transcode` need MakeMKV/HandBrake), so the shared dependency layer isn't shared enough to justify a submodule. The `arm-dependencies` submodule stays in the repo untouched through v3 development and is deleted in the cutover PR — see [08-v2-isolation-and-cutover.md](08-v2-isolation-and-cutover.md).
- **No `phusion/baseimage`.** phusion was adopted in v2 to get multi-service supervision (`/sbin/my_init` + `/etc/service/` runit) inside one container. v3's topology is one long-running process per container (UI = nginx, Backend = uvicorn, Ripper = the drive poller, Transcode = HandBrake — all PID-1-appropriate), so the entire reason phusion was chosen no longer applies. Dropping it removes a stack of v2 friction: the UID-unsettable limitation and its UID/GID remap dance, the `start_udev.sh` "job control turned off" noise in every bug report, the ~1 GB base-image bloat, and the two-repo version-bump tax that the submodule coupling created. Replacement bases are per service:
  - `arm-ui` → `nginx:alpine`, PID 1 = the nginx master (handles signals natively, no grandchild forks).
  - `arm-backend` → `python:3.14-slim-bookworm`, PID 1 = `tini` → `uvicorn`.
  - `arm-ripper` → `python:3.14-slim-bookworm`, PID 1 = `tini` → poller.
  - `arm-transcode` → `python:3.14-slim-bookworm`, PID 1 = `tini` → HandBrake wrapper.

  `tini` is baked into the Python images rather than relying on `docker run --init`, since not every Docker UI or orchestrator consistently surfaces that flag. It reaps the zombie `makemkvcon` / `HandBrakeCLI` / `ffmpeg` subprocesses the ripper and transcode containers fork. The UI spawns no grandchildren, so nginx as PID 1 is sufficient. The common PUID-remap + CA-merge + privilege-drop logic is a ~25-line `docker-entrypoint.sh` stored at `services/_common/docker-entrypoint.sh` and `COPY`ed into each Python image — a shared script, deliberately not a shared base image (a shared base was the `arm-dependencies` coupling we left behind). Hardened vendor bases (Chainguard, distroless, Bitnami Secure, Red Hat UBI Micro) were considered and rejected: paid tiers introduce a gated supply chain at odds with anonymous `docker pull` distribution; free/distroless tiers have no shell, which breaks the runtime CA merge + PUID remap + `gosu` pattern; and the threat model (LAN-only, internal CA, no internet-exposed services) doesn't justify the tradeoff. Supply-chain hygiene is added on top of the minimal bases instead (see the next bullet).
- **Supply-chain hygiene.** Minimal bases without vendor hardening means hardening is done at publish time with free open-source tooling:
  - **Pin bases by digest.** Dockerfiles reference `FROM python:3.14-slim-bookworm@sha256:...`, not floating tags. Renovate (or Dependabot) opens a PR when the upstream digest for the pinned tag changes.
  - **SBOM per image.** `syft` generates an SPDX SBOM at build time; `cosign attach sbom` publishes it alongside the image in the registry.
  - **Cosign-signed images.** Every published image is signed via Sigstore's keyless flow (OIDC from the GitHub Actions runner → short-lived Fulcio cert → Rekor transparency log). Users can verify with `cosign verify docker.io/automaticrippingmachine/arm-<service>:v3.x.y --certificate-identity=... --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`. No long-lived signing keys to manage.
  - **Weekly base rebuild.** A scheduled CI job rebuilds each image weekly on its current tag so Debian's security updates land without waiting for the next ARM release.
- **Each service has its own Dockerfile under `services/<service>/Dockerfile`.** Shared Python code (schemas, clients) lives in `packages/arm_common/` and is installed into each image by the build, not mounted at runtime — there is no v2-style `PYTHONPATH=/opt/arm` shim.
- **Nothing compiles on the host.** The installer (see [§ Install](#install)) only pulls pinned images from `docker.io/automaticrippingmachine/`. Contributors building locally use `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml build`; end users never do.

## Compose topology

The generated `~/arm/docker-compose.yml` references pinned images from `docker.io/automaticrippingmachine/` and bind-mounts paths under its own directory. No `build:` directives; nothing is compiled on the host.

```

The `armv3-` prefix on container names and `name: armv3` project namespace guarantee zero collision with v2 containers (which use `arm-` names) so `docker compose ls`, `docker compose down`, and `docker volume ls` all show v3 and v2 as distinct projects. One exception: containers the backend creates for enrolled drives (see below) are named `arm-ripper-<serial>` without the `armv3-` prefix — they're created over the docker socket, not by compose, so they sit outside the `armv3` compose project namespace.

### Rippers are created by the backend, not by compose

There is no per-drive compose service. `docker compose up -d --build` builds the
`arm-ripper` image (the service has `deploy.replicas: 0`, like `arm-transcode`)
and starts nothing from it. On boot the backend scans `/sys/class/block/sr*` +
`/dev/disk/by-id` (mounted read-only at `/host-disk`) and lists every optical
drive on the **Drives** page as *detected*. Enrolling a drive there makes the
backend create one durable container `arm-ripper-<serial>` for it over the
docker socket:

- label `arm.drive_id=<id>` (the tracking key), `restart: unless-stopped`;
- `device_cgroup_rules: ["b 11:* rmw", "c 21:* rmw"]` — the ripper's entrypoint
  pre-creates `/dev/sr0..7` and `/dev/sg0..15` itself, so there is no `devices:`
  bind and the container survives unplug/replug and renumbering;
- env `ARM_DRIVE_ID`, `ARM_DRIVE_BY_ID` (the udev by-id link it follows),
  `ARM_DRIVE_DEV` (current node — a hint), backend URL + service token,
  `PUID/PGID/CDROM_GID`, and any `ARM_RIPPER_*` tunables from `.env`;
- mounts the `ARM_HOST_RAW_PATH` / `ARM_HOST_LOGS_PATH` host paths (which the
  install layout resolves to `./arm/raw`, `./arm/logs`), `arm-ca.crt:ro`,
  `/dev/disk:/host-disk:ro`.

Unenroll stops and removes the container. On every backend boot the `drives`
table is reconciled against the labelled containers: missing → created, exited
→ started, orphan → removed, and a container running an image that no longer
matches `ARM_RIPPER_IMAGE` is recreated when the drive is idle. These
containers are **outside the compose project** — `docker compose down` leaves
them; `bash devtools/ripper-containers.sh {list|stop|remove}` manages them.

Each service container, on startup, copies the mounted `/etc/ssl/arm/arm-ca.crt` into `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` and runs `update-ca-certificates`. This merges the per-install internal CA with the base image's Mozilla root bundle, so outbound HTTPS (TMDB, OMDB, Apprise) verifies against public roots and inbound/intra-compose HTTPS verifies against the internal CA — all via the default system trust store, no per-client `verify=` plumbing in application code. See [05-cross-cutting.md § Transport (TLS)](05-cross-cutting.md#transport-tls) for the full cert layout and rationale.

Note that v2 may be simultaneously bound to `/dev/sr0`. If you want to run a real v3 rip, stop v2 first — the kernel permits multiple containers to map the same device but MakeMKV won't play nicely with the disc being used by two processes. This is the one unavoidable resource conflict and it only matters during the transition period.

Transcode services are NOT declared in compose — they are spawned dynamically by the Backend via Docker socket.

### SCSI-generic pairing

Each ripper container needs **both** the block device (`/dev/srN`) **and** its matching SCSI-generic node (`/dev/sgM`). MakeMKV enumerates drives via SG ioctls, not by opening the block device — without the sg node, `makemkvcon info` returns `Unknown device - '/dev/srN'` and zero titles. The ripper's scan dispatcher silently falls through to the data-disc fallback in that case, so the failure mode is "every disc looks unidentifiable" rather than a clean error.

The pairing isn't lexicographic — `sr0` does **not** automatically pair with `sg0`. Find the matching node from the kernel device tree:

```sh
ls /sys/class/block/sr0/device/scsi_generic/   # → e.g. "sg5"
```

Rippers no longer need this pairing done for them: the `arm-ripper-<serial>` container's entrypoint pre-creates `/dev/sr0..7` and `/dev/sg0..15` itself (via `device_cgroup_rules`, not per-node `devices:` binds), so it can follow the kernel's own `sr`↔`sg` pairing at runtime instead of a compose author working it out at install time — see [§ Rippers are created by the backend, not by compose](#rippers-are-created-by-the-backend-not-by-compose) above.

### Host-side auto-mount must be disabled

Desktop hosts (any with a GNOME / KDE / XFCE session) run `udisks2` + `gvfs` to auto-mount removable media as soon as the kernel sees a new disc. That host-side mount holds `/dev/srN` exclusively — the ripper container can scan and rip (`makemkvcon` opens the SCSI generic node, not the block device), but **post-rip `eject` fails with "Device or resource busy"** because the container can't reach the host's mount namespace to unmount first. The ripper logs `eject /dev/srN failed after 4 attempts; check host auto-mount config` and the disc stays in the drive until the user manually ejects.

Server / headless installs do not have this problem (no `udisks2` running, no `gvfs`). Desktop hosts need a one-time host config change to disable auto-mount for optical drives (non-optical media untouched; other optical drives stay visible and manually mountable). The canonical udisks2 knob for this is `UDISKS_AUTO=0` ([udisks(8)](https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/udisks2/udisks.8.en.html)) — the drive stays visible in Files / Nautilus and the user can still mount it on demand, but the desktop's auto-mounter skips it on insert.

The rule is host-wide rather than scoped to a specific drive by `ID_PATH`/`ID_SERIAL`, because drives are hot-plugged and enrolled from the UI *after* install — there is no fixed drive list at install time to scope the rule to. ARM owns the optical drives on its host, so the installer (and `devtools/setup-dev.sh` for contributors) writes one rule that covers every `sr*` node:

```sh
# /etc/udev/rules.d/99-arm-no-automount.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="block", KERNEL=="sr[0-9]*", ENV{UDISKS_AUTO}="0"
```

Reload with `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger`. After this, eject from inside the ripper container succeeds normally.

Why `UDISKS_AUTO=0` and not `UDISKS_IGNORE=1`: the latter hides the drive from the udisks2 device tree entirely (no entry in Files, no `udisksctl status` row), which is friendlier to set-it-and-forget-it server installs but breaks the desktop user's expectation that they can still browse the disc manually. `UDISKS_AUTO=0` is the documented per-device "skip auto-mount" toggle. Why a host-side rule instead of bind-mounting the host's DBus into the container: DBus passthrough adds a runtime dependency that fails open on headless hosts (no `udisks2` running) and ties container behaviour to the host's session bus — fragile across distros and reboots. Why not raw SCSI eject through `/dev/sgM`: `udisks2` sets PREVENT MEDIUM REMOVAL on mount, the drive firmware refuses STOP UNIT until ALLOW is sent, and even on success the host's `/media/<label>/` mountpoint stays stale and races the next disc insertion. Multiple containerized rip projects ([jlesage/docker-makemkv #84](https://github.com/jlesage/docker-makemkv/issues/84), [#138](https://github.com/jlesage/docker-makemkv/issues/138), [ARM v2 #1558](https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine/issues/1558)) hit this same wall and none of them solve it in-container — the host-udev approach is the converged industry pattern.

## Why one ripper container per drive

One drive is one process is one crash domain: a failing ripper doesn't take down its siblings, and each container holds its own MakeMKV SCSI handle on its own device rather than multiplexing several drives through one process. Logs stay per-drive too — one JSONL stream per container, not an interleaved shared one. Each ripper watches its own drive via a 2s `ioctl(CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS)` poll.

The container itself isn't declared in compose, though — it's created by the backend when a drive is enrolled, not hand-written per drive. See [§ Rippers are created by the backend, not by compose](#rippers-are-created-by-the-backend-not-by-compose) above.

## Environment file

`~/arm/.env` holds bootstrap values. The installer generates it with sensible defaults; the user edits only the optional fields (API keys, non-default ports) — and even those are primarily set via the UI, not the env file.

```bash
# Generated by the installer — do not commit
POSTGRES_USER=arm
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<generated: openssl rand -hex 24>
POSTGRES_DB=arm
ARM_SERVICE_TOKEN=<generated: openssl rand -hex 32>
PUID=<host user's UID, `id -u`>
PGID=<host user's GID, `id -g`>
CDROM_GID=<detected via `stat -c %g /dev/sr0`, else 44>
ARM_LOG_LEVEL=info
```

`DATABASE_URL` is composed from these at compose-parse time for the Backend; see the compose snippet above.

The pair of `~/arm/.env` + `~/arm/docker-compose.yml` is all a running install depends on. Re-running the installer on an existing install preserves `.env` (only re-derives `PUID`/`PGID`/`CDROM_GID` if those host facts changed), preserves the CA, and only *adds* new ripper service blocks for newly-attached drives. Upgrades come from the image tags in the compose file, not from editing `.env`.

## File ownership

v3 uses the linuxserver.io-style `PUID`/`PGID` pattern to keep files on `/raw` and `/media` owned by a UID/GID the user controls — typically matching their media server (Plex/Jellyfin) so downstream consumers can read the files without any post-hoc `chown`.

**How it works:**

- Each service's entrypoint starts as root, creates (or adjusts) an internal user to match `PUID:PGID` from the environment, then `gosu`/`s6-setuidgid` drops privileges before any filesystem write. Every byte ARM writes is owned by `PUID:PGID`.
- Ripper and transcoder share `PGID` so group-writable handoff on `/raw` works (transcoder reads + deletes intermediate files written by ripper). They also share `PUID` for simplicity; Backend and UI use the same PUID/PGID but never write to user-facing volumes — DB state lives in the Postgres-managed volume, which doesn't need to match.
- The writing process runs with `umask 002` and the output roots (`/raw`, `/media`) have the `setgid` bit (`chmod g+s`) set on first boot, so every subdirectory ARM creates inherits the parent group and is group-writable. This is what fixes the "directories ARM creates are owned by root" failure mode.
- **v3 never `chown -R` a user-mounted volume.** If ownership is wrong at startup, the container logs a clear diagnostic and exits; it does not mutate the mount. This is the single biggest lesson from v2: recursive chown at startup clobbered user-owned Plex libraries (issue #1147), broke NFS mounts (#1186), and generated a long string of "fix permissions AGAIN" commits. v3 treats bind-mount ownership as user-owned state, not something the container manages.

**Host preparation (once, at install):**

- Create the `/raw` and `/media` host directories owned `PUID:PGID` with mode `2775` (setgid + group-writable). The installer does this.
- If using NFS, export with `no_root_squash` is **not** needed — ARM never writes as root. Export with a squash that maps to `PUID` is fine.
- If using SMB/CIFS from a NAS, mount with `uid=$PUID,gid=$PGID,forceuid,forcegid`. This works identically on Linux and Windows hosts (WSL2).
- For Windows hosts running the UI/transcoder stack: use a WSL2-native filesystem path, a named Docker volume, or an SMB mount. NTFS bind mounts from `C:\...` are unsupported — the translation layer ignores `chown`/`chmod` and PUID becomes cosmetic.

**Mismatched owners across `/raw` and `/media`:** common when `/raw` is local disk and `/media` is a NAS share — the underlying storage may belong to a different account on each host. The stack has one `PUID:PGID` for everything, so reconcile at the mount layer rather than asking the container to span two identities: SMB/CIFS with `uid=$PUID,gid=$PGID,forceuid,forcegid` rewrites every write to PUID on the wire regardless of the server-side account; NFS with idmapd (or a squash that maps to PUID) does the same. After that the container only ever sees PUID:PGID on both volumes and the asymmetry disappears. If you skip reconciliation, the startup ownership precondition fails fast on whichever volume doesn't match — by design, since v3 will not `chown -R` a user-mounted volume.

**Optical-drive device access:**

The ripper containers also need `group_add: ["${CDROM_GID}"]` so the PUID-dropped process can read `/dev/sr*`. `CDROM_GID` is the host's optical group GID (typically `44` for Debian/Ubuntu `cdrom`, sometimes `19` for Arch `optical`). The installer detects it via `stat -c %g /dev/sr0`. **No optical groups are hardcoded at image-build time** — a common v2 failure mode where the image's `cdrom` group had a different GID from the host's and the container couldn't read the drive.

## Privilege matrix

| Container | Privileged? | Socket / Devices | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `arm-db` | no | — | Standard Postgres image. |
| `arm-backend` | no | `/var/run/docker.sock` | Root-equivalent on the host. Acceptable; documented. |
| `arm-ui` | no | — | Stateless. |
| `arm-ripper-*` | no | `/dev/sr*` | Drive exposed via compose `devices:` (no `--privileged`, no manual cgroup rules). Host's optical GID passed via `group_add: ["${CDROM_GID}"]` so the PUID-dropped process can read the device node. Nothing is hardcoded at image-build time. |
| `arm-transcode-*` | no | optionally `/dev/dri`, NVIDIA runtime | Transient. |

No `privileged: true` anywhere. If a ripper ever needs it for a weird host, we document that as an escape hatch but do not ship it on.

## Install

A single command bootstraps the whole stack:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine/main/install.sh | bash
```

(Or `bash -c "$(curl -fsSL ...)"` for users who want a TTY; `install.sh --prefix /srv/arm` to override the default path.)

> `install.sh` predates the drive-lifecycle model and still emits per-drive services; it is scheduled for a rewrite before release — use [devtools/setup-dev.sh](../../../devtools/setup-dev.sh) (which follows the model above) meanwhile.

**What the installer does, in order:**

1. **Prereq check.** `docker` ≥ 24, `docker compose` v2, `openssl` ≥ 1.1.1, `bash` ≥ 4. User is in the `docker` group (or `sudo` usable), and in the host's optical group. Fails fast with a clear message if anything is missing.
2. **Create the install prefix** (`~/arm/` by default) with the layout shown above. Correct permissions on `certs/` (0700), `.env` (0600), and `raw`/`media` (2775 setgid). Run as the invoking user — no `sudo` needed if `~/arm/` is writable.
3. **Generate the internal CA** at `~/arm/certs/arm-ca.{key,crt}` (EC P-384, 10-year expiry, CN = "ARM v3 Local CA"). The key is `0400`, stays on the host, and is never mounted into any container.
4. **Probe for optical drives** via `ls /dev/sr* 2>/dev/null`; for each, generate a leaf cert (`arm-ripper-srN.{key,crt}`) signed by the CA. Also generate leaves for `arm-backend`, `arm-ui`, and `arm-db`. All leaves have a 10-year expiry. Leaf keys are written `0400` owned by the invoking user; the `arm-db` container re-permissions its leaf at startup via an entrypoint wrapper (see the compose block above) because Postgres refuses to read an SSL key not owned by the `postgres` user.
5. **Seed `~/arm/.env`** from a bundled template: `ARM_SERVICE_TOKEN` (`openssl rand -hex 32`), `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (`openssl rand -hex 24`), `PUID=$(id -u)`, `PGID=$(id -g)`, `CDROM_GID=$(stat -c %g /dev/sr0)` (falls back to `44` if no drive is present). Third-party API keys are left blank for the user to fill via the UI later.
6. **Generate `~/arm/docker-compose.yml`** from a bundled template, emitting one `arm-ripper-srN` service block per detected drive (with the corresponding cert mounts). If no drives are detected, the stack still installs — only the ripper services are omitted — and a warning is printed.
7. **Print next steps.** Install location, `cd ~/arm && docker compose up -d`, where to find the admin password once Backend boots (`docker compose logs arm-backend | grep "admin password"`), and how to import `arm-ca.crt` into a browser/OS trust store to clear cert warnings on the LAN.

`install.sh --start` runs `docker compose up -d` at the end; the default is "show me the commands" so the user can inspect the generated files before starting anything.

**Idempotent rerun.** Re-running `install.sh` is safe and recommended when adding drives, upgrading across major versions, or recovering from local edits:

- **Existing `.env` is preserved.** Only `PUID`/`PGID`/`CDROM_GID` are re-derived from the host and overwritten if they drifted.
- **Existing CA is preserved.** The CA is the one cert LAN clients have imported into their trust stores; regenerating it would force every browser, phone, and laptop to re-import. `install.sh --rotate-ca` is a separate, explicit subcommand that regenerates the CA + all leaves (with a confirmation prompt — the nuclear option for suspected CA key compromise).
- **All leaf certs are regenerated every run**, signed by the existing CA. Leaves are disposable — LAN clients trust the CA, not the specific leaf, so new leaves are invisible across the network. This self-heals hand-edited / corrupted / stale leaves and picks up SAN changes (e.g. host LAN hostname changed, new drive added) without any special flag or branching in the installer. Running containers keep their in-memory cert until restart; the `docker compose up -d` the user runs next cycles anything whose config changed.
- **Newly-detected drives** get a new `arm-ripper-srN` service block appended to the compose file and a matching leaf cert.
- **Previously-removed drives** leave their service blocks intact (inert when the device is absent) — the user explicitly deletes them if they want. Their leaf certs also get regenerated on rerun, which is harmless.

**First-boot sequence** (after `docker compose up -d`):

1. Backend starts, waits for Postgres, runs `alembic upgrade head`, seeds the `admin` user with a random password written to `/logs/first-boot.log` and printed to stdout.
2. User navigates to `https://host:8081`, accepts the internal-CA cert warning on first visit (or imports `~/arm/certs/arm-ca.crt` into the OS/browser trust store once to clear it for every device on the LAN — see [05-cross-cutting.md § Transport (TLS)](05-cross-cutting.md#transport-tls)), logs in as `admin` with the printed password, is forced to change it.
3. User enters third-party API keys in the UI → stored in `config`.
4. Rippers register themselves with Backend, appear in UI.
5. User inserts a disc; flow proceeds as documented in [02-job-lifecycle.md](02-job-lifecycle.md).

## Update / upgrade

- v3 images are tagged `docker.io/automaticrippingmachine/arm-<service>:v3.<x>.<y>`. Keeping the registry and namespace path from v2 so existing users don't have to follow a new identity.
- Upgrade a minor version = `cd ~/arm && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. Backend runs migrations; DB schema moves forward.
- Upgrade a major version = rerun `install.sh` to pick up any new service blocks or cert SANs the release requires, then `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.
- **No rollback of DB schema.** Alembic `downgrade` is not supported past minor versions — back up the DB if paranoid.

## Uninstall

```bash
cd ~/arm && docker compose down
rm -rf ~/arm
```

That's it. No systemd units, no distro integration, no state anywhere else on the host.

## Backup

Four things to back up, in priority order:

1. **`~/arm/certs/arm-ca.key`.** Unique-per-install and unrecoverable. If lost, the user has to rotate the CA and re-import on every LAN client — recoverable but annoying.
2. **Postgres dump.** `pg_dump` from a cron against the `armv3-db` container; ARM doesn't manage this. Contains plaintext secrets — store the dump somewhere you'd trust with a password export.
3. **`~/arm/.env`.** Useful for reproducing a deployment quickly; losing it just means regenerating `ARM_SERVICE_TOKEN` and the DB password (which then requires restoring the Postgres dump with matching credentials, or renaming the DB user).
4. **`~/arm/raw` and `~/arm/media`.** User's responsibility; these are large and the user knows their own backup strategy.

`~/arm/docker-compose.yml` is regeneratable by rerunning `install.sh` against the same `.env` and `certs/`, so it doesn't strictly need a backup.

## Platform-specific notes

- **Bare-metal Docker on Linux**: the one supported path. Install via `install.sh` and run `docker compose up -d`; all docs default to this. NAS-appliance GUIs (Unraid/Synology) are out of scope for v3.0 — see "Explicitly NOT supported" above.
