# MakeMKV

ARM rips **video** discs (DVD and Blu-ray) with [MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com/).
The ripper image builds MakeMKV from the official signed source — no licence is
baked into the image, so every ripper container needs a working key at runtime.
(Audio CDs don't touch MakeMKV; they're ripped with abcde. Data discs are imaged
directly.)

## How the key works

Before each disc, the ripper runs a small script that ensures a key is in place,
choosing one of three paths, in precedence order:

1. **You set it in the UI** *(recommended).* Open **Config → MakeMKV key** and
   paste your key (a purchased permanent key, or a beta you grabbed yourself).
   The ripper fetches it from the backend before each rip — no file editing, and
   it survives a `docker compose down`/recreate. A key set here **overrides** the
   `MAKEMKV_KEY` env var below, and you can change it without restarting anything.
2. **You supply a key via env.** Set `MAKEMKV_KEY=T-…` in `~/arm/.env`. Used when
   the UI key is blank. The script writes it into the container's
   `~/.MakeMKV/settings.conf`.
3. **You leave both unset.** The script scrapes the *current month's free beta
   key* from MakeMKV's public forum thread and uses that. This is the same
   approach ARM has shipped for years and is fine for DVDs, but the forum sits
   behind Cloudflare and rate-limits, so the scrape is brittle under load.

The free beta key rotates roughly monthly. Because the refresh runs per disc, a
container left running across a rotation **self-heals on the next disc** — no
restart needed.

After setting a key (whichever path), verify it landed:

```bash
cd ~/arm && docker compose exec arm-ripper-sr0 grep app_Key /home/arm/.MakeMKV/settings.conf
```

(The UI path takes effect on the next rip; the env path needs `docker compose up -d`.)

## Buying a key

While MakeMKV is in beta the free key works, but you can buy a permanent key to
avoid the monthly rotation and the forum scrape: <https://www.makemkv.com/buy/>.
Paste it into **Config → MakeMKV key** (path 1 above), or set it as `MAKEMKV_KEY`.

## DVD vs Blu-ray — where the key actually matters

| Disc type | Needs a valid key? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| DVD (CSS or unprotected) | **No** | CSS support is in the open-source half of MakeMKV. |
| Blu-ray (AACS) | **Yes** | AACS is in the closed-source binary, gated by registration. |
| UHD Blu-ray (AACS 2.0) | **Yes** | Same path; also needs a compatible "friendly" UHD drive. |
| Audio CD | **No** | Ripped with abcde + cdparanoia, not MakeMKV. |

So if DVDs rip fine but Blu-rays fail with `App key incorrect`, the key is the
problem. If **every** MakeMKV call fails with `MSG:5021 … application version is
too old`, that's a different issue: MakeMKV beta binaries carry a hard ~60-day
kill switch and **no key overrides it** — you wait for the next upstream beta and
rebuild the ripper image. DVDs keep working in the meantime. Full failure-mode

## Licence

Using MakeMKV means accepting its EULA. The full text is mirrored at
**[MakeMKV EULA](MakeMKV-EULA)**. Note in particular that MakeMKV can bypass
copy protection to read a disc, and it's your responsibility to comply with the
copyright law in your jurisdiction.
