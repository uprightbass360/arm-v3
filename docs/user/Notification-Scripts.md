# Bash hook scripts

A **Bash script** notification channel (a "hook") runs a script of yours when
a subscribed event fires. It is the v3 successor of v2's `BASH_SCRIPT`
setting with the same calling convention, plus declared inputs, per-event
overrides, and a test panel.

## Where scripts live

Put executable files in `arm/scripts/` under the install prefix (next to
`arm/media` and `arm/raw`). The backend sees the directory read-only at
`/scripts`. In Settings > Notifications, add a channel of type Bash script
and pick the file. Files without the execute bit are listed but cannot be
picked.

    cp docs/user/examples/send-email.sh arm/scripts/
    chmod +x arm/scripts/send-email.sh

`devtools/setup-dev.sh` creates the directory and generates the compose file
with the mount from `docker-compose.yml.example`. A stack that predates this
feature has neither; to add them by hand, create `scripts/` next to `media/`
in the install prefix and give the `arm-backend` service this volume in
`docker-compose.override.yml` (then `docker compose up -d arm-backend`):

    services:
      arm-backend:
        volumes:
          - ./scripts:/scripts:ro

Until the mount exists the picker shows "No scripts found" for every file
you add.

## Calling convention

    /usr/bin/env bash /scripts/<script> "<title>" "<body>"

`$1` is the rendered title and `$2` the rendered body after the channel's
per-event overrides. That is exactly what v2 passed.

Every render-context variable is also exported as an `ARM_*` variable:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ARM_EVENT_TYPE` | `rip.completed`, `rip.partial`, `rip.failed`, `rip.needs_user_input`, `session.completed`, `session.partial`, `session.failed` |
| `ARM_JOB_ID`, `ARM_JOB_TITLE`, `ARM_JOB_YEAR`, `ARM_JOB_DISC_TYPE`, `ARM_DRIVE_ID`, `ARM_OCCURRED_AT` | job and event envelope |
| `ARM_STATUS`, `ARM_TRACKS_DONE`, `ARM_TRACKS_FAILED`, `ARM_TRACKS_TOTAL` | `rip.*` events |
| `ARM_STATUS`, `ARM_SESSION_ID`, `ARM_SESSION_APPLICATION_ID` | `session.*` events |
| `ARM_VOLUME_LABEL`, `ARM_DISC_TYPE` | `rip.needs_user_input` |
| `ARM_TITLE`, `ARM_BODY` | same values as `$1` and `$2` |
| `ARM_MEDIA_ROOT`, `ARM_RAW_ROOT` | `/media` and `/raw` inside the container |

Unknown values are empty strings. `GET /api/notifications/event-types` is
the authoritative per-event list. The Test panel in the UI shows the exact
values for a chosen event.

## Declaring inputs

Add comment lines to the top of the script (first 60 lines):

    # arm-hook: Send an email through an SMTP relay
    # arm-input: TO        label="Recipient"     required
    # arm-input: SUBJECT   label="Subject"       default="ARM {event_type}: {job_title}"
    # arm-input: PRIORITY  label="Priority"      values=low,normal,high default=normal
    # arm-input: SMTP_PASS label="SMTP password" secret

The UI renders one field per `arm-input` line, and the value reaches the
script as an environment variable with that exact name (`$TO`, `$SUBJECT`).

- `KEY` must be upper-case letters, digits, and underscores, and must not
  start with `ARM_` (reserved). A few shell-sensitive names are refused too
  (`PATH`, `HOME`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `LD_PRELOAD`,
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `SHELLOPTS`, `BASHOPTS`, `IFS`, `PS4`, `CDPATH`,
  `GLOBIGNORE`); a line declaring one of them is ignored.
- `label="..."` is the field label (defaults to the key).
- `default="..."` is used when the field is left blank. Values may use the
  same `{variables}` as title and body.
- `values=a,b,c` renders a select and rejects anything else.
- `required` fails the run when the value is empty.
- `secret` renders a password field, stores the value masked, and cannot be
  overridden per event.

Only declared inputs reach the script. A stored or per-event value whose key
no script header declares is ignored, so a script with no `arm-input` lines
still works and gets `$1`, `$2`, and the `ARM_*` variables, and nothing else.

## Per-event overrides

Each subscribed event can override the title, the body, and every non-secret
input. Blank fields inherit the hook's values. Typical use: one email hook
subscribed to `rip.completed` and `rip.failed`, with `rip.failed` sending to
an on-call address with `PRIORITY=high`.

## Where the script runs

Inside the `arm-backend` container, as the `PUID` user:

- tools: bash, coreutils, `curl`. No `rsync`, `rclone`, `ffmpeg`, or
  `mkvpropedit` unless you add them (see below)
- paths: `/scripts` (read-only), `/media`, `/raw`, `/logs`
- network: the compose network and outbound internet
- not available: host binaries, `systemctl`, `eject`, host paths that are
  not mounted

To use extra tools or paths, extend the backend image or add a bind mount in
`docker-compose.override.yml`:

    services:
      arm-backend:
        volumes:
          - /mnt/nas/movies:/mnt/nas/movies

The backend's own environment (database URL, service token) is never passed
to the script. Only `PATH`, `HOME`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, the `ARM_*` variables,
and the declared inputs are.

## Failures and timeouts

The script must exit 0 within the channel's timeout (default 30 seconds,
maximum 600). A non-zero exit, a timeout, a missing file, a missing execute
bit, a missing required input, or a template error is recorded on the
channel and in the dispatch log with the reason and the first 200 characters
of stderr, with any secret input value replaced by `<hidden>`. There is no
retry. The Test panel shows the full stdout and stderr (up to 4 KB each) of a
test run.

## Examples

- [send-email.sh](examples/send-email.sh): email through an SMTP relay with
  curl; recipient, subject, and priority per event.
- [plex-refresh.sh](examples/plex-refresh.sh): refresh a Plex library section
  on `session.completed`.

## Migrating from v2 `BASH_SCRIPT`

Copy the file into `arm/scripts/`, make it executable, add a Bash script
channel that points at it, and subscribe it to every event. `$1` and `$2`
are unchanged. v2's `[ARM_NAME]` prefix and `NOTIFY_JOBID` suffix are not
applied; set them in the per-event title template instead.
