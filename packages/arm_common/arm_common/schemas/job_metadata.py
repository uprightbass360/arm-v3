"""Typed core for `jobs.metadata_json` (gap analysis §3.4).

The bag holds four kinds of content, and this module gives each a home:

- `scan_result` — the full ScanResult dump from identify time (load-bearing:
  rip-start's track selection reads it). Already typed by `ScanResult`.
- `identity` — what identification concluded: which provider, the external
  ids, the synopsis. Written at identify; never merged from raw payloads.
- `music` — provider-shaped section with a real reader (the music naming tokens).
- `identity_claims` — per-source identity proposals (arm_backend.identity).
- `flags` — booleans that steer behaviour (`unidentified` parks placeholder
  rips at ripped_awaiting_identify; `dispatch_timeout` is diagnostic).
- `provider_raw` — everything a provider returned, keyed by provider name.
  Data for the raw viewer and future backfills, never read for behaviour.
  Rows migrated from the old top-level merge keep theirs under `"legacy"`.

`extra="allow"` everywhere: the `pending_session_id` mirror that used to live
in this bag is gone (removed in the job-identity-columns branch; the UIs now
read the `pending_session_id` job column). `extra="allow"` is kept
deliberately for one more release as a grace period for rows written before
migration 0031, so a validate/dump round-trip on old data doesn't drop
whatever was there; tighten to `forbid` once those rows are confirmed gone.
