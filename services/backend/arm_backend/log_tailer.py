"""Phase 12 — singleton tail of `/logs/*.log` → `logs.{job_id}` WS topic.

A single asyncio task started in the FastAPI lifespan, mirroring the shape
of `NotificationDispatcher`. Each tick:

1. Rescan `/logs` for new `*.log` files; open any not yet tracked.
2. Drain new lines from each tracked file via `run_in_executor(readline)`
   so blocking I/O does not pin the event loop.
3. Detect rotation by comparing `os.stat(path).st_ino` to the cached
   inode. On a flip, drain remaining bytes from the old fd, close it,
   and reopen by path.
4. For each parsed JSON line carrying a `job_id`, append the raw line
   to `/logs/jobs/{job_id}.log` — the per-job aggregated log used by
   the zip / stream endpoints and removed on job-delete.
5. For each line whose `job_id` has at least one subscriber on
   `logs.{job_id}` (`hub.subscriber_count`), emit the line as a
   `log.line` event with `persist=False`.

Loop guard: records emitted by the WS hub itself (`extra.logger`
starting with `arm_backend.ws.hub`) are skipped before WS emit only —
they're still appended to the per-job file (file writes have no
feedback risk; the hub-emit-failure log is genuinely diagnostic).

Subscriber sees only future lines after subscribing. Earlier lines are
available via the `/api/logs/{job_id}` (NDJSON stream) and
`/api/logs/{job_id}.zip` endpoints, both backed by the per-job file.
