"""In-process passthrough execution (TranscodeTool.NONE / no-preset tasks).

Passthrough is a file move, not an encode, so the backend performs it
itself instead of spawning a transcoder container (no-transcode-mode spec).
The task lifecycle mirrors the container path exactly, so the transcodes UI
and session rollups cannot tell the difference. The blocking move runs in a
thread; a large cross-mount copy must not stall the event loop.

NFS note: writes happen as the BACKEND's uid. The deployment doc requires
the backend PUID to have write access to /media; when ARM_TRANSCODE_PUID is
set we chown best-effort after the move (a root-squashed export makes that
a harmless no-op).

    Mirrors the container path's lifecycle exactly (claim fields,
    application QUEUED -> RUNNING, session.started / task.started /
    task.completed / task.failed WS events, application aggregation).
    Returns True on DONE, False on FAILED, or None if the task could not be
    claimed at all (see below), not an error, just a lost race.

    Commits internally at two points instead of leaving the commit to the
    caller: once right after the claim (before the move), and once after
    the terminal state + events are written. The dispatcher tick's
    `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` holds row locks on every queued row
    it fetched; under the shipped compose layout /raw and /media are
    separate bind mounts, so the "move" is actually a full cross-mount copy
    (`os.rename` fails EXDEV, `transcode_none` falls back to copy+unlink),
    slow enough that holding those locks (and a long-open transaction) across
    it would stall a freshly spawned encode container's `/claim` call past
    its HTTP timeout. Committing the claim first ends that locking
    transaction before any blocking I/O runs.

    Because the tick's initial select may have grabbed this row minutes
    earlier (an earlier task's move can run long) and ANY earlier
    passthrough task's claim commit releases every lock that transaction
    held (COMMIT is transaction-scoped, not row-scoped), not just its
    own row's; a concurrent writer (`DELETE /api/transcodes/{id}`, an
    `overwrite` eviction, a job-delete cascade) can remove or repurpose
    this row before we get to it. Re-select it by id, locked, and bail out
    cleanly if it's gone or no longer QUEUED instead of attempting a claim
    UPDATE against a row that isn't there (which raises
    `sqlalchemy.orm.exc.StaleDataError`).

    Because the claim is durably committed before the move, the row can
    also be deleted out from under this function by a concurrent
    `cancel_running` while the copy itself is in flight. Before writing the
    terminal state we re-fetch the row by id again; if it's gone, we log and
    return cleanly instead of resurrecting a cancelled task.
