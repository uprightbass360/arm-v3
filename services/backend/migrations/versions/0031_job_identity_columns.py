"""Job identity columns: media_type, season, pending_session_id.

Step 2 of docs/plans/AUTOMATION_GAP_ANALYSIS.md (§3.4): facts that drive
routing, naming or queries move out of the free-form metadata_json bag into
real columns.

- media_type — the identified kind (movie/tv/music/data/iso), set at
  identify from the provider result, correctable at resolve. VARCHAR +
  app-layer validation; never a Postgres enum.
- season — user-supplied TV season (G-14: the {season} naming token reads
  this column now).
- pending_session_id — the explicit per-rip session choice, previously a
  metadata key. FK → sessions.id ON DELETE SET NULL: a deleted session must
  not strand the job (the routed-session resolver falls back).

Data lift (PostgreSQL only — the tooling that runs migrations elsewhere has
no legacy rows):
- pending_session_id is copied from the metadata key where that id still
  resolves to a session (the FK would reject the rest); the metadata mirror
  is left in place — both UIs still read it until the JobMetadata schema
  migration removes it.
- season / disc metadata keys are lifted into season / disc_number where
  numeric and the column is unfilled, and the loose keys are dropped so the
  naming tokens and the columns can no longer disagree (G-14).

Downgrade drops the columns; lifted-and-dropped season/disc keys are not
restored to metadata_json.
