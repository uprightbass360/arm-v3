"""Scrub the lifted-to-column mirror keys out of jobs.metadata_json.

Step 2 lockdown slice (docs/plans/AUTOMATION_GAP_ANALYSIS.md §3.4): 0031
lifted `pending_session_id` (and `season`/`disc`) into real columns but kept
the metadata_json copies around "until both UIs read the column." They do
now (`JobView.pending_session_id` is exposed; both UIs prefer the column),
so identify no longer writes the mirror and this migration removes the
stray top-level `pending_session_id`, `season`, and `disc` keys from
existing rows. In practice, 0031 already dropped `season`/`disc` from any
row it touched during its own lift, so on an already-migrated database this
migration's only real scrub target is `pending_session_id`; the other two
keys are covered defensively in case a row reached this point without going
through 0031's lift (e.g. written between 0031 and 0032 by code that still
had a mirror write path).

Per row (PostgreSQL only, in Python — same as 0031/0032, not sane SQL):
strip any of MIRROR_KEYS found at the top level of metadata_json and
rewrite the row only when something changed.

Idempotent: a row with none of the mirror keys is left untouched (the loop
rewrites nothing). Downgrade is a no-op — this is a data-only scrub, and the
dropped keys are not restored (they are redundant with the columns).
