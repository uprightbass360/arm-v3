"""Source-path classification: real optical drive vs an .iso file on disk.

`ARM_SOURCE_PATH` lets the ripper run its scan → identify → rip
pipeline against a file image instead of `/dev/sr0`. Four code paths
need to know which mode they're in (MakeMKV source URL on scan, MakeMKV
source URL on rip, mount options on the disc probe, drive-status probe
in the heartbeat). Rather than thread a mode flag through each callsite,
they each call `is_iso_source` on the bound device_path string.
