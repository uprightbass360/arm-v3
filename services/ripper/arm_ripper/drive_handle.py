"""The single source of truth for "which node is my drive on right now".

Before this existed, the poll loop, heartbeat loop, JobController, boot
probe and eject each held their own copy of the device path, captured
once at startup. After a renumbering replug they disagreed: the poll loop
followed the drive while the heartbeat probed a stale node forever and a
manual rip could target another drive entirely. Every consumer now reads
this handle; only the poll loop writes it.
