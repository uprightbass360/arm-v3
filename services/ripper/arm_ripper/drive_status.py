"""Synchronous drive-status probe shared across the ripper service.

Used by the heartbeat task to post the drive's current media status to
the backend, which then powers the manual-rip API's "tray-open / empty"
pre-check.

The probe is a pure ioctl read — `CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS` returns the
medium-presence signal without touching the SCSI read path. Cheap
enough to run every HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS.

(Earlier versions of this file also offered a `verify_read=True` mode
that pulled bytes from offset 0 to catch the "drive reports CDS_DISC_OK
but next SCSI read returns NOT_READY" case. That whole class of failure
came from the per-title rip loop letting the drive idle between
`makemkvcon` invocations; with the single-invocation rip the drive
stays open for the entire rip and the verify-read path is no longer
needed. See [.claude/memory/](.claude/memory/) for the rationale.)
