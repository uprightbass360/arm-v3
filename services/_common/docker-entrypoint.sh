# ---------------------------------------------------------------- optical nodes
# The ripper is NOT given its drive via a compose/docker `devices:` bind. Docker
# resolves those at container-create time, so an absent drive fails creation
# before the restart policy can engage, and a drive replugged later never
# appears inside a running container (moby#46608, moby#19763). Instead the
# container's device cgroup is granted the optical majors (b 11 = sr*, c 21 =
# sg*) and the nodes are created here.
#
# This works for hotplug because the kernel binds names to numbers statically:
# sr<N> is always block 11:<N> and sg<N> is always char 21:<N>. A node for a
# minor with no hardware behind it is harmless — open() gets ENXIO — and the
# same node starts working the moment a drive is enumerated onto that minor.
# So a fixed range created up front covers drives that come and go, and drives
# that come back under a different number, with no runtime mknod and no extra
# privilege: CAP_MKNOD is in Docker's default set and the cgroup rule's `m`
# bit permits it for exactly these majors.
#
# Both sr and sg are required: MakeMKV enumerates drives from real device
# nodes in the container's own /dev (symlinks and sg-only were both verified
# to fail) and pairs each sr with its sg itself.
#
# Existing nodes are skipped. Defined above the SOURCE_ONLY seam so
# test-entrypoint-optical.sh can exercise it unprivileged.
